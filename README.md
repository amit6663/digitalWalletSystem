# Digital Wallet System
I've developed a digital wallet system that enables users to transfer funds between their wallets.
The account balance cannot drop below ₹ 0.00.
The smallest amount that can be transferred between wallets is 0.0001.
The user gets these options for each action. And the options are as follows:
1. Create Wallet – This option will create a wallet for the user.
2. Transfer Amount – This option will enable the transfer of funds from one account to the other.
3. Transaction History – This option will display the account statement for the specified user.
4. Overview – This option will display all the account numbers currently in the system. Additionally, it shows the current balances for these accounts.
5. Exit – The system will exit.
